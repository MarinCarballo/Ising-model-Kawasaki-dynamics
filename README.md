# Ising-model-Kawasaki-dynamics
Code in C and simulation tools for the Ising Model using Kawasaki dynamics. 
Kawasaki dynamics is a type of stochastic process. In this model, instead of flipping individual spins as in Glauber dynamics, Kawasaki dynamics involves the exchange of neighboring spins. This type of dynamics *conserves the total magnetization of the system*.
