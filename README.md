# Ising-model-Kawasaki-dynamics
Code in C and simulation tools for the Ising Model using Kawasaki dynamics. 
Kawasaki dynamics is a type of stochastic process. In this model, instead of flipping individual spins as in Glauber dynamics, Kawasaki dynamics involves the exchange of neighboring spins. This type of dynamics *conserves the total magnetization of the system*.

At low temperature, the expected Ising dynamics, with vast magnetic dominions and a well-ordered system, appeared:

I calculated some observables in this systems like:
### Density in function of the coordenate y of the lattice net:

### Magnetization of the first and the second half on the lattice net:

### Energy per particle:
